How to Use requirements.txt

1.  Create the file: In the root directory of your project, create a new file named requirements.txt.

2.  Add dependencies: List each required library on a new line. You can specify version numbers using operators like `==` (exact version), `>=` (minimum version), or `<` (maximum version). Specifying a minimum version is generally a good practice to prevent compatibility issues with older library versions.

3.  Install dependencies: To install all the listed libraries, a user can simply navigate to your project directory in their terminal and run the following command:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
